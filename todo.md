# features
- create simple prompt home page
- get user input, and use AI api to get some information on this prompt
( what kind of prompt is it, a question? a softwarwe? a math equation? a decleration)
- handle the prompt responses, and use a follow up api for it, so wolfram alpha for math api
-  


# goal
- can be prompted on 
    - *a software
    - a math equation
    - grammar/essay?
    - *** a general question
- potentially return links regarding that?

## future
- rename this to something awesome
cd nex

### ideas
- "multi" prompt type of prompts. one prompt is turned into multiple, what is the poroimpt. do we need an api? do we need links? etc?

# questions
- how do i rename/redo hierarchy all this shit to fit my repo?
- way to approach getting input and then calling api's? as a component? a script? (my copmonents folder, etc...)
- how to return the state variable back to parent, go to another route and be passed to another component in this route


- the point of value attribute and with use state, etc. [is for control, value attribute allows for instant control, can be dosplayed. with var.value, is only recieved when user clicks the button ONLY. so one you alwyas have the data on change, the other only on submti (kinda)]
